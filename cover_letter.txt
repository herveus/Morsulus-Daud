From Morsulus: On Da'ud encoding and DOT ABOVE and DOT BELOW

It was discovered that the Da'ud code {z.} was defined as both Z WITH DOT ABOVE
and Z WITH DOT BELOW. This is clearly not a good thing. It has been fixed. The
meaning of a dot in a Da'ud code is now consistent.

That is, El{z.}bieta Piekarska could have had the dot above or below the z, and 
trying to look it up in the table of Da'ud codes would not have helped you out.

{.*} now signifies * WITH DOT ABOVE, and {*.} signifies * WITH DOT BELOW, for
all values of "*" from "a" to "z", upper and lower case (at least as far as 
those letters are already in the list). 

What changed?

{.e} and {.E} for E WITH DOT ABOVE were added
{.I} was defined to be LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE where it had been {I.}.
{I.} was redefined to be LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT BELOW as it had been some time ago.
{.z} and {.Z} were redefined to be LETTER Z WITH DOT ABOVE instead of DOT BELOW.

This required recoding six names that used letters with DOT ABOVE. Those names are now
coded as:

D{zv}iugint{.e} Litovka
El{.z}bieta Piekarska
El{.z}bieta Traidenyt{.e}
{.I}slah bint Yuhannah
G{u:}rc{u:} {.I}skender
Umm Davud Mihri bint {.I}skender

The names have not changed, just the Da'ud codes used for some of their letter.

The full chart at http://oanda.sca.org/data_symbols.html has been updated
to reflect these changes.
