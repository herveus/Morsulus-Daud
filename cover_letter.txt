From Morsulus: On Da'ud encoding and DOT ABOVE and DOT BELOW

It was discovered that the Da'ud code {z.} was defined as both Z WITH DOT ABOVE
and Z WITH DOT BELOW. This is clearly not a good thing. It has been fixed. The
meaning of a dot in a Da'ud code is now consistent.

{.z} now signifies Z WITH DOT ABOVE, and {z.} signifies Z WITH DOT BELOW, for
all values of "z" from "a" to "z", upper and lower case (at least as far as 
those letters are already in the list). This required recoding six names that
used letters with DOT ABOVE. Those names are (in their new form):

D{zv}iugint{.e} Litovka
El{.z}bieta Piekarska
El{.z}bieta Traidenyt{.e}
{.I}slah bint Yuhannah
G{u:}rc{u:} {.I}skender
Umm Davud Mihri bint {.I}skender

The full chart at http://oanda.sca.org/data_symbols.html has been updated
to reflect these changes.
